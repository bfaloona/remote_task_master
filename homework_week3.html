<H3 id="part_one__remotetaskmaster">Part One - RemoteTaskMaster</H3>

<P>You will hook your Taskmaster DSL from last week to DRb. The idea is to have a server into which you can load tasks and then execute them remotely.</P>

<P>A few changes to the requirements:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If you built your DSL using a different vocabulary, please update it to use the terminology shown <A href="http://uwruby.bleything.net/advanced/homework/week2.html">in the assignment</A>. Note that <CODE>recipe</CODE> has been changed to <CODE>task</CODE>.</LI>

<LI>At the end of the <CODE>Taskmaster.cookbook</CODE> run, your code should validate that all of the dependent tasks exist. If you encounter a missing dependency, raise an exception.</LI>
</UL>

<P>New requirements:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The server should keep the list of defined tasks for the life of the server… that is, if you disconnect and reconnect the client, the tasks should stay defined</LI>

<LI>Add a method called <CODE>run_list_for</CODE> that takes a task name as an argument and returns the complete list of tasks, in order, to satisfy its dependencies and run the task</LI>
</UL>

<P>Notes:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Running a single task multiple times should execute the dependencies each time… that is, track the dependencies in the scope of a single <CODE>Taskmaster.run</CODE> call</LI>
</UL>

<H3 id="part_two__a_small_network_service">Part Two - A Small Network Service</H3>

<P>You will build a very small, naive authentication service. Given a username and password, your service will report whether or not the user is authorized.</P>

<P>You will build both the client and server using <CODE>TCPSocket</CODE>. The server should listen on port 24842. Connection flow looks like this:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The client connects to the server and sends the username</LI>

<LI>The server responds with an unknown, opaque string. This string should change on every request.</LI>

<LI>The client salts the password with the string, hashes the resulting string, and sends it to the server</LI>

<LI>The server replies with either “AUTHORIZED” or “NOT AUTHORIZED” and disconnects</LI>
</OL>

<P>The server should read a password file (located in the same directory as the <CODE>server.rb</CODE> file called <CODE>passwd</CODE>) that looks like the example below. Note that this is valid YAML so you should use the YAML library to read it:</P>

</DIV>
<P><STRONG>Requirements</STRONG></P>

<UL>
<LI>You <STRONG><EM>must</EM></STRONG> write tests for this part of the assignment. Try to build it test-first</LI>

<LI>The client should take the username and password as arguments on the command line: <CODE>./client.rb ben p4ssw0rd</CODE></LI>

<LI>Nothing should be send in plaintext. You should use <CODE>Digest::MD5</CODE> to hash the salt + password in step 3 above.</LI>

<LI>Both the client and server should log debugging information</LI>

<LI>It is very important that you follow the protocol exactly. I will be testing your server with my client, and your client with my server to ensure correctness.</LI>
